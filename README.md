# CircuitAnalyzer

Your task is to write a program for circuit analysis, i.e. a program that can model circuits of resistors under DC power. 

The operations that your program should be able to perform are the following:

a) Resistance of the overall circuit and of the individual components of the circuit

b) Given a voltage applied to the overall circuit, the resulting voltage at the individual components.

c) Given a voltage applied to the overall circuit, the resulting current flowing through the overall circuit
and through individual components of the circuit.

## To Do:
- Avoid redefinition of base class attributes (member variables) in derived class.
- Improve code comment
