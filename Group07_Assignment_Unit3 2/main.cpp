Pseudo-code
User selects a circuit to be modeled
Based on the selected option, a circuit model is generated
    Each component is represened in a top down approach as a unit class
    A Circuit Base class is defined with pure virutal methods for component resistance, voltage drop and current through
    Unit, Series and Parallel are concrete derived classes of the ciruict abstract class
    Unit class contains resistor class as a composition
    When a Parallel relation is encountered, Unit representations are passed 
    Using circuit analysis (KVL and KCL),
    A method is defined from a pure virtual function in the abstract class to derive resultant resistance of the passed unit components
    A method is defined to calculate the voltage drop accross each component
    - the voltage drop of resistance in parallel is equal,
    - get resultant resistance of parallel resistance and multiply by total circuit current to get voltage drop 
    - Vdrop = totalCurrent * (Ra//Rb)
    A method is defined to derive the current through each component
    - Ia = Vdrop/Ra; Ib = Vdrop/Rb;
    A method is defined for a string representation of passed components
    When a Series relation is encountered, Unit representations are passed 
    Using circuit analysis (KVL and KCL),
    define a method from abstract class for resultant resistance
    - method is defined by calculating parallel resistance
    define a method from abstract class for current through components
    - current through a resistance in series is equal to the total current of the circuit
    define a method from abstract class for voltage drops 
    - the voltage drop of each component is the components resitance divided by the total circuit current
    The final circuit composition will encompass all components in series
  Generated model resolves the total resistance of the mono circuit parameters that make up the model
  Resultant resistance is stored in circuit base class
Accept voltage accross the entire circuit from user
  total voltage is stored in the base class
    on storing voltage, total current through the circuit is calculated using Ohm's law
    total current is stored in circuit
Provide interface for circuit analysis to user
Accept users choice
When case 1
  Get the stored total resistance of the circuit
When case 2
  Get the total stored voltage value from base class
When case 3
  Return the total current through circuit
When case 4
  Output hardcoded circuit representation to user (will be generated in next version) 
When case 5
  Get total resistance of each resistor circuit that makes up the model
    access the stored resistance of each resistor instance 
When case 6 (to be implemented in next version)
  Get total current through each resistor circuit that makes up the model
    access the stored resistance of each resistor instance
    (in next version, value of current through will be calculated when specific circuit "parallel/series" accepts a resistor
  resolved current will then be assigned to current attribute in resistor object for later access)
When case 7 
  Get total voltage drop accross each resistor circuit that makes up the model
    access the stored resistance of each resistor instance
  (in next version, voltage drop value will be calculated when specific circuit "parallel/series" accepts a resistor
  resolved drop will then be assigned to voltage attribute in resistor object for future access)
  
When case 8
  Step out of considered circuit model and prompt user to make another choice
If case 1 or 2
  continue analysis
If case 3
  Exit application
